# MergeOrderLog

MergeOrderLog is a command-line tool that will merge multiple log files generated by log4Net from multiple sources within a specified directory. The final log will be organized chronologically.

## Features

- _Merge Logs_: Combines all (`.log` or `.log.1`, `.log.2`,etc) files in a specified directory and its subdirectories.
- _Order by Date_: Orders log entries chronologically based on the timestamp.
